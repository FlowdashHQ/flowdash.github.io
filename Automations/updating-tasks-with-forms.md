Asking for information has gotten easier! You can email a request to anybody for information and their response will be saved into your task. These forms can only be used to update a task once.

First let's create a form and include the fields that provide relevant contextual information and the information you want. For example, below I have a form for customers to upload their receipts
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a097c18-upload-receipts-form.png",
        "upload-receipts-form.png",
        692,
        740,
        "#f8f9fa"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Now that we have the form users will use, let's add it into our process. In the [Flow Builder](doc:accessing-the-flow-builder) select the action to add the Email a form step
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/fc22301-email-a-form-step.png",
        "email-a-form-step.png",
        321,
        467,
        "#f8f6f6"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
In the modal fill out who should receive this email and if you want to provide them a message.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2a51315-email-a-form.png",
        "email-a-form.png",
        1071,
        714,
        "#edf2ef"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Email a form step can also be used in automations!"
}
[/block]
Save your action with this new step and the next time this action is performed, a form will be sent to the user.

Flowdash is an ultra-customizable task management platform for operationally-intense businesses. Combining the familiarity and simplicity of task trackers (Asana, Trello, Monday) with powerful APIs, webhooks, integrations, and automations, Flowdash enables operations and engineering to quickly build maintainable, scalable, and customizable task management software that fit business needs perfectly.

# First steps

Are you brand new to Flowdash?  This is the place to start!

* **Build a workflow from scratch** with the [Quickstart](doc:quickstart) guide.

# How the documentation is organized

Flowdash has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* Tutorials take you by the hands through a series of steps to create an end-to-end workflow. Start here if you're new to Flowdash. 

* Key concepts discuss concepts at a high level and provide useful background information and explanation prior to diving into the reference.

* Reference guides contain a detailed reference to most of the Flowdash features. They describe how it works and how to use it, but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Flowdash works.

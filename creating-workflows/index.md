Once you've set up a **data model**, you'll want to think about the workflow itself. For each task, what is the specific
process that your team should follow to complete that task? What are the major steps (or stages) of that process? What
actions can users take at each step in the process? In Flowdash, these are all configured visually through the **Flow
Builder**.

With a **data model** defined, you are able to add tasks to your workflow. There are a few different ways to do so, depending on your use case.

# Manually creating a task

To create a new task directly in Flowdash, simply click the `+ New Task` button in the workflow table page. You'll notice a modal pop-up with all previously defined custom fields.

# Import from CSV

In cases where you want to migrate an existing data set to Flowdash, you can bulk import tasks using a CSV import.

# Import from Form

Sometimes, you want a public-facing form that anyone can use to submit data to Flowdash. In those cases, you can design a web form within Flowdash that will automatically push responses to your workflow.

# Import from API

Another way to create tasks is programmatically through the API. This is useful when integrating with your core application, or using [Zapier](doc:connect-to-zapier) to integrate with another 3rd party software. Learn more about [using the API to create tasks](doc:tasks-api).

One way to create tasks in Flowdash is by using custom forms. 

Setting one up takes about a minute with the drag-and-drop builder.

To get started, open up a workflow and navigate to `Data > Forms > + New Form`. 

Use the right hand panel to customize (1) the layout of the form (e.g., add a header, description, or your company logo as an image), and (2) the fields you'd like to request (e.g., Email, Name, Phone, etc.). 

When you drag in fields, you'll have the option of making them required on the form or not. You can also add a custom tooltip message for more context.

  "body": "There's a difference between required fields at the task creation level and at the form level. For example, you can set up your fields in the workflow so that `Email` is not required, but you make it required in your form. If a field is required at the task creation level, however, it will always be required in the form."

You can create a new stage by clicking the "New Stage" button at the top of the Flow Builder:
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9fff6f2-new-stage_.png",
        "new-stage .png",
        2648,
        1320,
        "#f9fafa"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
When creating a new stage, you can specify
* a unique name for the stage in your workflow.
* an optional color, to make it easier to identify the stage at a glance.
* whether the stage is an "end stage", meaning that tasks in this stage are considered done and don't require further action.
* an optional [checklist](doc:stage-checklists) your team should follow.

For consistency, whenever a stage is shown in Flowdash, it'll always be accompanied by a circle of the specified color. For example:
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/555e653-approved-stage.png",
        "approved-stage.png",
        202,
        54,
        "#e5e9e7"
      ],
      "sizing": "smart"
    }
  ]
}
